# SmartBin
This is a project developed at the 2018 WiCS Hackathon.  Our idea was to build a weight sensor inside of a trashcan using a Raspberry Pi and to transmit data from the trashcan to a Node JS web application.  The web app would store the data inside of a Mongo database and render it on a webpage in a useful, graphical format for the user to track how much garbage they are generating.
